WHY ARE THERE SIX JARS?  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
===============================================

We are including six jars with the Velocity distribution. This
document describes the differences and what they are intended for.

All of the jars are included in the root directory of the Velocity
distribution.

CAVEAT: Up and including the 1.4 release of Velocity, there was a
wealth of different jars including J2EE code, containing just the
runtime or the tools. This lead to some confusion about the naming and
the purpose of the various jars.

Starting with the 1.5 release of Velocity, there is now one jar,
velocity-<version>.jar, which contains all Velocity code, and four
jars, velocity-engine-<module>-<version>.jar, which contains some specific Velocity
code.


velocity-<version>.jar
----------------------

  This jar contains all the velocity specific code in the
  org.apache.velocity.* packages.

  If you want to integrate Velocity easily in your own code or a larger
  project and you are not in a Maven environment, we recommend that you use
  this jar.

  It has some external dependencies which are listed in the developer
  docs. Make sure that you have these dependencies present in your
  application.

  Please see the developers guide for more information.


velocity-engine-core-<version>.jar
--------------------------

  This jar contains only the main part of Velocity. Useful if you don't need
  special logging requisites (it works fine with JDK 1.4 logger).

velocity-engine-commons-logging-<version>.jar
--------------------------

  This jar contains the Commons Logging Log Chute, that allows logging using
  Commons Logging.
  It needs to be used together with velocity-engine-core-<version>.jar

velocity-engine-log4j-<version>.jar
--------------------------

  This jar contains the Log4J Log Chute, that allows logging using Log4j.
  It needs to be used together with velocity-engine-core-<version>.jar

velocity-engine-slf4j-<version>.jar
--------------------------

  This jar contains the SLF4J Log Chute, that allows logging using
  Commons Logging.
  It needs to be used together with velocity-engine-core-<version>.jar

velocity-engine-servlet-<version>.jar
--------------------------

  This jar contains the Servlet Logger Log Chute, that allows logging using
  logging methods provided by servlets.
  It needs to be used together with velocity-engine-core-<version>.jar
